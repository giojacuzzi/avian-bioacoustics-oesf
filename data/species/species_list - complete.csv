White-crowned Sparrow,6,Varied Thrush,"The song of the White-crowned Sparrow Is one of the most-studied sounds in all of animal behavior. Different subspecies across the country sing clearly different songs, but they’re all recognizable by the sweet, whistling introduction, a succession of jumbled whistles, and a buzz or trill near the end. Songs last 2-3 seconds. Females sing only rarely.","White-crowned Sparrows have about 10 different calls. The most frequently heard include a sharp pink, lower-pitched than the White-throated Sparrow’s call. It’s usually made by males or as an alarm call near the nest. They also make a harsh, rasping call used by sparrows during altercations.",,https://search.macaulaylibrary.org/catalog?regionCode=US-WA&tag=song&taxonCode=pswspa1,Zonotrichia leucophrys,YES,whcspa,pugetensis,Scrub,Year round,C,22 Mar-14 Jun,21 Jun-2 Aug,9 Aug-22 Nov,1.3,0.3,2,LC,https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/peterson-field-guide-to-bird-sounds/,Sometimes found in forests,,,,1

White-throated Sparrow,6,Varied Thrush,"White-throated Sparrows sing a pretty, thin whistle that sounds like Oh-sweet-canada-canada or Old-Sam-Peabody-Peabody. The whistles are even but typically move slightly up or down in pitch by the second or third note. The whole song lasts about 4 seconds. White-throated Sparrows sing often during the breeding season, even in the middle of the day, and on their winter range as well. Males of both forms sing, and so does the “white-striped” female. “Tan-striped” females sing very rarely.","The main call of the White-throated Sparrow is a sharp, explosive, chink, often given by an agitated bird with crown feathers raised, flicking its tail. It’s an alarm call often given near a nest or when a predator or other threat has been spotted. A two-parted chip-up is a sign of aggression between two birds or given when adults arrive at the nest. White-throated Sparrows also make a trill that can be up to 2 seconds long. Females do this as part of courtship; males sometimes use trills to signal aggression as they push their head forward and flutter their wings.

Wilson's Warbler,6,Warblers,"The song of the Wilson’s Warbler is simple with a sweet quality. Their fast, slightly accelerating song is a string of similar notes, dropping downward in pitch toward the end, that ring loud and clear even next to noisy streams. Males sing for about 2 seconds, pause for several seconds and burst into song again, singing around 5 songs per minute. Unlike other warblers, females also occasionally sing. Males start singing just before they leave the wintering grounds and continue to sing throughout migration and on the breeding grounds. Once they start nesting, they sing less frequently.","Like other warblers, male and female Wilson’s Warblers give a single chip note to communicate with mates and young and to notify territory intruders.

Yellow Warbler,6,Warblers,Males sing a sweet series of 6–10 whistled notes that accelerate over the course of the roughly 1-second song and often end on a rising note. The tone is so sweet that people often remember it with the mnemonic sweet sweet sweet I’m so sweet. The songs are a common sound of spring and early summer mornings and may be repeated as often as 10 times per minute.,"Yellow Warblers use a variety of short chip notes, some with a metallic sound and some with a lisping or buzzing quality.
