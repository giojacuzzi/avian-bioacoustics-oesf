species_list_WA.txt was created from the union of the following sources (NOT the full join):
- Official Washington State Checklist of Birds, Washington Bird Records Committee (Nov 2023) https://wos.org/records/checklist/, including only those species NOT on the Review List
- Wildlife-Habitat Relationships in Oregon and Washington, Johnson and O'Neil (2001) https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-H-Johnson/publication/323425044_Wildlife_Habitat_Relationships_in_Oregon_and_Washington/links/5a955fc345851535bcdbe1e5/Wildlife-Habitat-Relationships-in-Oregon-and-Washington.pdf, including only those species with Washington occurrence statuses Occurs, Non-native, Reintroduced

Only those species that were available in BirdNET were included.

------

species_list_OESF.txt was created by taking all forest and early-seral associated species (i.e. coniferous forest, deciduous/coniferous mixed forest, or brush/thickets) from the WA Bird Records Committee and the Johnson and O'Neil list that appear on the checklist by the North Olympic Peninsula Audubon Society AND are listed as present in the nearby Olympic National Park AND breed within Washington. This list was validated by 2x ornithologists.
- See https://olympicpeninsulaaudubon.org/checklist for Olympic Peninsula Audubon Society (2018)
- See https://www.nps.gov/im/nccn/olym.htm#OLYMspecies for species present in OLYM NP (2024)
- See https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-H-Johnson/publication/323425044_Wildlife_Habitat_Relationships_in_Oregon_and_Washington/links/5a955fc345851535bcdbe1e5/Wildlife-Habitat-Relationships-in-Oregon-and-Washington.pdf for species breeding status in Washington

Process for including:
- Is the species forest OR early-seral associated (CDT)?
- Is the species listed as a resident (i.e. non-vagrant or accidental) by the OPAS OR is present in the OLYM NP?
- Is the species a potential resident during the breeding season, as indicated by Johnson and O'Neil?

Only those species that were available in BirdNET were included.
